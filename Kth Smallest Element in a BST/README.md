# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the `kth` smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
