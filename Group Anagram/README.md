# Palindromic Substrings

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

### Example

Input: `s = "abc"`
Output: `3`
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`.

Input: `s = "aaa"`
Output: `6`
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: `"a"`, `"a"`, `"a"`, `"aa"`, `"aa"`, `"aaa"`.

### Constraints

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

In this format, the problem description, examples, and constraints are clearly separated and easy to read. The headings and bold text help to highlight important information, and the code blocks make it clear what the inputs and expected outputs are.

You can also consider adding additional sections to your README.md file, such as a section on your approach to the problem or a section on how to run the code.
