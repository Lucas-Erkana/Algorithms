# Problem Statement

The awards committee of your alma mater (i.e. your college/university) asked for your assistance with a budget allocation problem they’re facing. Originally, the committee planned to give `N` research grants this year. However, due to spending cutbacks, the budget was reduced to `newBudget` dollars and now they need to reallocate the grants. The committee made a decision that they’d like to impact as few grant recipients as possible by applying a maximum cap on all grants. Every grant initially planned to be higher than `cap` will now be exactly `cap` dollars. Grants less or equal to `cap`, obviously, won’t be impacted.

Given an array `grantsArray` of the original grants and the reduced budget `newBudget`, write a function `findGrantsCap` that finds in the most efficient manner a `cap` such that the least number of recipients is impacted and that the new budget constraint is met (i.e. sum of the `N` reallocated grants equals to `newBudget`).

## Example

```
input:  grantsArray = [2, 100, 50, 120, 1000], newBudget = 190
output: 47 # and given this cap the new grants array would be
           # [2, 47, 47, 47, 47]. Notice that the sum of the
           # new grants is indeed 190
```

## Constraints

- 0 ≤ grantsArray.length ≤ 20
- 0 ≤ grantsArray[i]
- Time limit: 5000ms
