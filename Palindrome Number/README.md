## 9. Palindrome Number

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Constraints

- -2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
